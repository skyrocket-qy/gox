# Skip List

*   **Space and Time Complexity**:
    *   Space: `O(N)` average.
    *   Time (Search, Insert, Delete): `O(log N)` average.

*   **Use Case**: High-performance database indexing for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, especially in concurrent environments.

*   **Pros**:
    *   Simpler to implement than balanced trees.
    *   Good average performance for search, insertion, and deletion.
    *   Well-suited for concurrent applications.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Uses more memory.
    *   Performance is probabilistic, not guaranteed.
