# HyperLogLog++

*   **Space and Time Complexity**:
    *   Space: `O(m)` registers (dense) or `O(k)` (sparse). Extremely space-efficient.
    *   Time (Add): `O(1)` average.
    *   Time (Estimate, Merge): `O(m)` (dense) or `O(k)` (sparse).

*   **Use Case**: More accurate unique user counting for smaller websites, providing precise unique counts across a wider range of scales with minimal memory.

*   **Pros**:
    *   Improved accuracy over standard HyperLogLog, especially for smaller cardinalities.
    *   Maintains extreme space efficiency.
    *   Supports union operation for distributed counting.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Result is an approximation.
    *   Cannot retrieve actual items or support deletions.
    *   Slightly more complex implementation.
