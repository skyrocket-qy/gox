# Coordination Consensus

This section discusses consensus mechanisms specifically in the context of distributed coordination.

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Databases (e.g., Google Spanner, CockroachDB):** These databases use consensus algorithms (like Paxos or Raft) to ensure that all replicas agree on the state of the data, enabling strong consistency and fault tolerance.

-   **Distributed Coordination Services (e.g., Apache ZooKeeper, etcd):** These services are built on consensus protocols to provide a consistent and highly available shared state for distributed applications, used for leader election, configuration management, and service discovery.

-   **Leader Election:** In many distributed systems, a leader needs to be elected to coordinate tasks or handle writes. Consensus algorithms are used to reliably elect a single leader among a group of nodes.

-   **Distributed Transactions:** While complex, some distributed transaction protocols (e.g., Two-Phase Commit) aim to achieve consensus among participating nodes to either commit or abort a transaction atomically.

-   **State Machine Replication:** Systems that replicate a state machine across multiple nodes use consensus to ensure that all nodes process the same sequence of commands in the same order, maintaining a consistent state.
