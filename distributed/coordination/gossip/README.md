The Gossip protocol, also known as the epidemic protocol, is a style of computer-to-computer communication inspired by the way diseases spread or rumors circulate among humans. In a distributed system, nodes periodically exchange information with a small, randomly selected set of other nodes. This decentralized communication pattern ensures that information eventually propagates throughout the entire network without relying on a central coordinator. It's commonly used for tasks like membership management, failure detection, and data dissemination due to its robustness, scalability, and fault tolerance.
