# Coordination

## Core

**Coordination** is the process of managing the interactions and dependencies between multiple processes in a distributed system. In a distributed environment, where processes are running on different nodes and communicating over a network, it's essential to have mechanisms in place to ensure that they can work together in a consistent and orderly manner.

Without proper coordination, a distributed system can suffer from a variety of problems, including:
- **Race Conditions:** When multiple processes attempt to access the same shared resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Deadlocks:** When two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Inconsistent State:** When different nodes in the system have different views of the same data.
