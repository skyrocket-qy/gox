# Coordination

## Core

**Coordination** is the process of managing the interactions and dependencies between multiple processes in a distributed system. In a distributed environment, where processes are running on different nodes and communicating over a network, it's essential to have mechanisms in place to ensure that they can work together in a consistent and orderly manner.

Without proper coordination, a distributed system can suffer from a variety of problems, including:
- **Race Conditions:** When multiple processes attempt to access the same shared resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Deadlocks:** When two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Inconsistent State:** When different nodes in the system have different views of the same data.


## Comparison

| Mechanism | Primary Goal | Scalability | Complexity | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Consensus](./consensus)** | Agreement | Low | High | Leader election, distributed transactions |
| **[Quorum](./quorum)** | Consistency | Medium | Medium | Read/write operations in replicated systems |
| **[Gossip](./gossip)** | Dissemination | High | Low | Cluster membership, failure detection |
| **[Vector Clock](./vector-clock)** | Causality | High | Medium | Detecting concurrent updates, versioning |
| **[CRDT](./crdt)** | Conflict-free replication | High | High | Collaborative applications |
| **[Event Streaming](./event-streaming)** | Data flow | High | Medium | Real-time data processing, microservices |

## Which service use it?



-   **Consensus:** Distributed databases (e.g., etcd, ZooKeeper, Apache Kafka for controller election), distributed transaction systems, and leader election in replicated systems.

-   **Quorum:** Distributed storage systems (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB), and any system requiring a certain number of nodes to agree on an operation for consistency.

-   **Gossip:** Cluster membership management (e.g., HashiCorp Serf, Apache Cassandra), failure detection, and data dissemination in large-scale distributed systems.

-   **Vector Clock:** Collaborative editing applications, distributed databases (e.g., Riak), and systems needing to track causal relationships between events.

-   **CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types):** Real-time collaborative applications (e.g., Google Docs-like editors), distributed counters, and shared data structures in eventually consistent systems.

-   **Event Streaming:** Microservices architectures, real-time analytics platforms, IoT data processing, and any system requiring asynchronous, decoupled communication and data flow.
