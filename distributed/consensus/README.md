# Consensus

**Consensus** is a fundamental problem in distributed systems that involves getting a group of processes to agree on a single value or decision. In a distributed environment where processes can fail or the network can be unreliable, achieving consensus is a surprisingly difficult challenge.

The primary goal of a consensus algorithm is to ensure that all non-failing processes in a distributed system eventually agree on the same value, and that this value was proposed by at least one of the processes. This is crucial for a wide range of distributed systems, including:
- **Replicated State Machines:** Ensuring that all replicas of a state machine execute the same sequence of operations in the same order.
- **Leader Election:** Deciding which node in a cluster should take on the role of the leader.
- **Distributed Transactions:** Coordinating a transaction across multiple nodes, ensuring that it either commits everywhere or aborts everywhere.

## Properties of Consensus Algorithms

A correct consensus algorithm must satisfy three key properties:
1.  **Agreement:** All non-failing processes must agree on the same value.
2.  **Validity:** The agreed-upon value must have been proposed by one of the processes.
3.  **Termination:** All non-failing processes must eventually decide on a value.

## Common Algorithms

Some of the most well-known consensus algorithms include:
- **Paxos:** A family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors.
- **Raft:** A consensus algorithm that is designed to be easier to understand than Paxos.

Achieving consensus in a distributed system often involves trade-offs between performance, fault tolerance, and complexity. The choice of which consensus algorithm to use depends on the specific requirements of the system.
