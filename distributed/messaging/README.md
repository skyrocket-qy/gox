# Messaging

Messaging in distributed systems refers to the communication paradigms and technologies that enable different components or services to exchange information asynchronously. It decouples senders from receivers, enhancing scalability, reliability, and flexibility. Key concepts include message queues, publish-subscribe models, and event streams.
