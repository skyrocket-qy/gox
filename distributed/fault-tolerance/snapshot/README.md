# Snapshot Recovery

This section describes Snapshot Recovery as a fault-tolerance mechanism, where the state of a distributed system is periodically saved to allow for quick restoration after a failure.

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Databases:** Many distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch) provide snapshot capabilities to create consistent backups of their data at a specific point in time, which can then be used for recovery.

-   **Virtual Machine (VM) Backups:** Virtualization platforms allow taking snapshots of entire VMs, including their memory, disk state, and configuration, enabling quick restoration to a previous state.

-   **Distributed File Systems:** File systems like ZFS or Btrfs support snapshotting, allowing users to revert to previous versions of files or entire file systems.

-   **Cloud Storage Services:** Cloud providers offer snapshot features for block storage volumes (e.g., AWS EBS snapshots) or entire virtual disks, facilitating disaster recovery and data migration.

-   **Data Warehouses and Analytics Platforms:** Snapshots are often used to create consistent copies of large datasets for reporting, analysis, or testing purposes, without impacting the live system.
