# Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance in distributed systems refers to the ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when one or more of its components fail. It involves designing systems to detect, isolate, and recover from failures without significant disruption to service. Techniques include replication, redundancy, checkpointing, and graceful degradation.
