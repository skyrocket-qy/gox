## Common service with their pattern

## Which service use it?

-   **Cloud Computing Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP):** These platforms are massive distributed systems that provide infrastructure, platforms, and software as services.
-   **Large-Scale Web Applications (e.g., Google Search, Facebook, Netflix):** These services handle billions of requests and petabytes of data by distributing their workload across thousands of servers.
-   **Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Spanner):** Databases designed to store and manage data across multiple nodes for scalability, availability, and fault tolerance.
-   **Big Data Processing Frameworks (e.g., Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark):** Systems that process and analyze vast datasets by distributing computation across clusters of machines.
-   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Networks of geographically distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their location, improving performance and availability.
-   **Financial Trading Systems:** High-frequency trading platforms and banking systems rely on distributed architectures for low-latency processing, high throughput, and strong consistency.
