# Multi-Leader Replication

This section explains Multi-Leader Replication, a data replication strategy where multiple nodes can act as leaders, accepting writes and then replicating them to other leaders and followers, often used for multi-datacenter deployments.

## Which service use it?



-   **Multi-Datacenter Deployments:** Organizations with a global presence often use multi-leader replication to allow writes to occur in different geographical regions, reducing latency for local users and improving disaster recovery capabilities.

-   **Some Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Couchbase):** These NoSQL databases support multi-leader configurations, allowing any node to accept writes and then propagate them to other nodes in the cluster.

-   **Collaborative Applications with Local Writes:** Applications where users in different locations need to make concurrent updates to shared data, and local responsiveness is critical. Conflict resolution mechanisms are essential here.

-   **Offline-First Applications:** Mobile or desktop applications that allow users to make changes while offline, and then synchronize those changes with a central system (which might be multi-leader) when connectivity is restored.
