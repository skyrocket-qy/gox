# Federated Multi-Cluster Mode

## Core

A **federated multi-cluster** system mode is an architectural pattern in which multiple, independent clusters are loosely coupled to form a larger, distributed system. Each cluster is self-contained and has its own control plane, but they can communicate and share resources with each other in a controlled manner.

This is in contrast to a single, large cluster, where all nodes are managed by a single control plane. Federation is often used in large-scale, geographically distributed systems, where it is not feasible or desirable to have a single, centralized control plane.

## How It Works

Federated systems typically use a set of APIs and protocols to enable communication and resource sharing between clusters. For example, a federated system might use a service mesh to route traffic between services in different clusters, or it might use a distributed storage system to replicate data between clusters.

Some common use cases for federation include:

-   **High Availability:** By distributing services across multiple clusters, a federated system can remain available even if one cluster fails.
-   **Geo-distribution:** Federation can be used to deploy services closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance.
-   **Scalability:** Federation can be used to scale a system beyond the limits of a single cluster.
-   **Multi-cloud:** Federation can be used to build systems that span multiple cloud providers, avoiding vendor lock-in.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

-   **Scalability:** Federated systems can be scaled to a much larger size than single-cluster systems.
-   **High Availability:** Federated systems are highly available, as they can tolerate the failure of an entire cluster.
-   **Flexibility:** Federation allows for a great deal of flexibility in how services are deployed and managed.

### Cons

-   **Complexity:** Federated systems can be complex to design, build, and operate.
-   **Security:** Securing a federated system can be challenging, as it is necessary to secure the communication between clusters.
-   **Cost:** Federated systems can be more expensive to operate than single-cluster systems, as they require more infrastructure.

## Which service use it?



-   **Kubernetes Federation:** While the original Kubernetes Federation v1 has evolved, the concept of managing and coordinating applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters (e.g., using tools like Kubefed or multi-cluster ingress controllers) is a prime example of a federated multi-cluster approach.

-   **Multi-Cloud Deployments:** Enterprises often deploy applications across different cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to avoid vendor lock-in, improve resilience, and optimize costs. These setups often involve federated control planes or management layers.

-   **Large-Scale Enterprise Systems:** Global companies with operations in multiple regions or data centers might use federated architectures to provide localized services while maintaining a global view or shared data.
