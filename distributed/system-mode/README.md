# System Modes

In the context of distributed systems, a **system mode** (also known as an architectural pattern or deployment model) describes the fundamental way in which the components of the system are organized and interact with each other. The choice of a system mode is a critical architectural decision that has a profound impact on the system's properties, such as its scalability, fault tolerance, consistency, and complexity.

Different system modes are suited for different types of applications and use cases. For example, a simple web application might be well-served by a traditional client-server model, while a large-scale, data-intensive application might require a more complex, peer-to-peer or microservices architecture.

## Common System Modes

This section provides an overview of some of the most common system modes found in distributed systems:

-   **Client-Server:** A traditional model where a central server provides services to a number of clients.
-   **Peer-to-Peer (P2P):** A decentralized model where all nodes are equal peers and can act as both clients and servers.
-   **Leader-Follower:** A model used in replicated systems where one node is designated as the leader and is responsible for coordinating the other nodes (the followers).
-   **Multi-Master:** A replication model where multiple nodes can accept writes, and the changes are replicated to all other nodes.
-   **Sharded (Partitioned):** A model where data is partitioned across a number of nodes, allowing the system to be scaled out horizontally.
-   **Shared-Nothing:** An architectural pattern where each node is independent and self-sufficient, and there is no single point of contention across the system.
-   **Microservices:** An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

Understanding the trade-offs between these different system modes is essential for designing and building effective distributed systems.
