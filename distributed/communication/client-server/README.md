# Client-Server Communication

This section describes the Client-Server communication model, a fundamental distributed system architecture where clients request services from servers.

## Which service use it?



-   **Web Applications:** The most ubiquitous example, where web browsers (clients) request web pages and resources from web servers.

-   **Email Services:** Email clients (e.g., Outlook, Gmail interface) communicate with email servers (e.g., SMTP, POP3, IMAP servers) to send and receive mail.

-   **File Servers:** Clients access and store files on a central file server (e.g., FTP, SMB/CIFS, NFS).

-   **Database Access:** Applications (clients) connect to a database server to query and manipulate data.

-   **Online Gaming:** Many online games use a client-server model where game clients connect to central game servers for multiplayer interactions and game state management.
