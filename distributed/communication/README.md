# Communication

## Core

In distributed systems, **communication** is the mechanism by which processes running on different nodes interact and exchange information. Effective communication is fundamental to the functioning of any distributed system, as it enables coordination, data sharing, and the execution of distributed algorithms.

This section explores various communication patterns, protocols, and models used for inter-process communication. Key challenges in distributed communication include handling network latency, ensuring message delivery, maintaining order, and dealing with failures.
