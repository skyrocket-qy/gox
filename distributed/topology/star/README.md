# Star Topology

This section explains the Star topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Local Area Networks (LANs):** The most common topology for modern wired LANs, where all computers and network devices connect to a central switch or hub.

-   **Client-Server Architectures:** In a client-server model, the server acts as the central hub, and all clients connect to it to request services.

-   **Centralized Monitoring Systems:** Monitoring agents on various machines report to a central monitoring server, forming a star-like communication pattern.

-   **Home Networks:** Most home Wi-Fi networks are essentially star topologies, with all devices connecting to the central router.

-   **Cloud Computing (Conceptual):** In many cloud deployments, virtual machines or containers communicate with central services (e.g., load balancers, databases, API gateways) in a star-like fashion.
