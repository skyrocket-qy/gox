# Mesh Topology

This section explains the Mesh topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Backbone Networks of the Internet:** The core routing infrastructure of the internet uses a highly interconnected mesh topology to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

-   **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs):** In WSNs, sensors often form a mesh network to relay data to a central sink, providing redundancy and extending network coverage.

-   **Critical Infrastructure Communications:** Systems requiring extremely high reliability, such as military communications or power grid control systems, often employ mesh topologies.

-   **Some Distributed Databases:** Certain distributed databases or storage systems might use a full or partial mesh topology for inter-node communication to ensure data replication and consistency.

-   **Service Meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd):** While not a physical network topology, the concept of a service mesh creates a logical mesh of communication between microservices, providing features like traffic management, observability, and security.
