# Bus Topology

This section explains the Bus topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Early Ethernet Networks:** Historically, 10Base2 (ThinNet) and 10Base5 (ThickNet) Ethernet networks used a bus topology where all devices were connected to a single coaxial cable.

-   **Industrial Control Systems (e.g., CAN bus):** In automotive and industrial automation, bus topologies like CAN (Controller Area Network) are used for communication between various electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors.

-   **Embedded Systems:** Simple embedded systems or sensor networks might use a bus topology for inter-component communication due to its simplicity and low cost.

-   **Peripheral Connections:** Internally, a computer's PCI bus or USB bus can be seen as a form of bus topology, where multiple devices share a common communication path.
