# Tree Topology

This section explains the Tree topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Large Corporate Networks:** Many large organizations use a tree topology to structure their network, with a root switch connecting to core switches, which then connect to distribution switches, and finally to access switches where end devices are connected.

-   **Cable TV Networks:** Cable television systems often use a tree topology to distribute signals from a central headend to individual subscribers.

-   **Hierarchical Network Designs:** Any network that requires a hierarchical structure for management, security, or performance segmentation can employ a tree topology.

-   **Distributed File Systems (Conceptual):** Some distributed file systems or data storage solutions might conceptually organize their nodes or data in a tree-like hierarchy for efficient data access and management.
