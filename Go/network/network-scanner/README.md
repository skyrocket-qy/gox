Distributed Network Scanner Project Overview
# Target
The goal of the Distributed Network Scanner is to create a system that scans a network (local or internet) for open ports and services, but instead of running on a single machine, the task is distributed across multiple nodes. This improves speed, scalability, and efficiency.

# Key Objectives
Understand Network Scanning Basics

Learn how TCP/UDP ports work and how services run on specific ports.
Understand techniques like SYN scanning, full TCP connect scans, and UDP scans.
Leverage Parallelism for Speed

Use multiple machines (or goroutines in Go) to divide and conquer the scan, testing many IP addresses and ports simultaneously.
Design Distributed Systems

Build a master-worker architecture where the master coordinates tasks and aggregates results, and workers perform the actual scanning.
Practice Efficient Networking in Go

Use Go’s net package to handle connections and the concurrency tools (goroutines, channels) to handle multiple tasks efficiently.
# Features of the Project
Port Scanning

Scan a range of ports (e.g., 1-65535) on a target IP address.
Identify open ports and potentially detect the services running on them.
Distributed Workload

Divide the scan across multiple worker nodes, either locally or on remote machines.
Allow workers to report progress and results back to the master.
Scalable Master-Worker Design

Use a central master node to:
Assign IP/port ranges to workers.
Aggregate scan results.
Manage worker node states (idle, active, etc.).
Concurrency for Speed

Use goroutines to parallelize scanning within each worker node.
Efficiently handle timeouts and retries for unreachable ports.
Result Aggregation and Reporting

Collect and display the results in a user-friendly format.
Support export options (e.g., JSON, CSV) for scanned data.
Fault Tolerance

Ensure that tasks are re-assigned if a worker fails or times out.
Handle unreliable networks gracefully.
# Project Benefits
Foundational Skills: Learn the basics of networking, protocols, and port scanning.
Concurrency: Gain expertise in using Go’s goroutines and channels.
Distributed Systems: Understand task distribution, message passing, and fault tolerance.
Real-World Utility: A distributed scanner can be used for network diagnostics, security assessments, or performance testing.
# Milestones
Basic Port Scanner

Write a simple program that scans a single target IP address and detects open ports.
Parallel Port Scanning

Extend the scanner to use goroutines to scan ports concurrently on a single machine.
Master-Worker System

Build a central master to divide scanning tasks among multiple workers.
Result Aggregation

Design a reporting system to aggregate and display results from all workers.
Distributed Deployment

Deploy workers on multiple machines and have them communicate with the master over the network (e.g., using gRPC or REST).
# Stretch Goals
Service Detection

Use techniques like banner grabbing to identify services running on open ports.
Security Features

Add rate limiting and blocklist support to avoid abuse or detection.
Dynamic Load Balancing

Dynamically adjust workload among workers based on their processing speed and network conditions.
Advanced UI

Create a dashboard (e.g., in React or Angular) to visualize the scanning progress in real time.
